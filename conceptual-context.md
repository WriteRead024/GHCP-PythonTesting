### GHCP-PythonTesting

# conceptual context

"CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the Python language." [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython)&nbsp; 
More information at [python.org](python.org).

"PyPy (/ˈpaɪpaɪ/) is an implementation of the Python programming language.[2] PyPy often runs faster than the standard implementation CPython because PyPy uses a just-in-time compiler.[3]" [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy)&nbsp;

# considering unit test frameworks

WriteRead024: "Hi Copilot, I am planning on working on some Python tests, what unit testing framework do you prefer or reccomend?"

GitHub Copilot: 

> "There are several unit testing frameworks in Python, but the most commonly used are unittest, pytest, and nose.

> unittest is built-in and doesn't require any additional installation. It's a bit more verbose but it's also very powerful and flexible.

> pytest is a third-party library that's very popular due to its simplicity and ease of use. It requires less boilerplate code than unittest and has some nice features like fixtures and parameterized tests.

> nose is another third-party library that's similar to pytest but is not as actively maintained.

> For most cases, I would recommend pytest due to its simplicity and powerful features. However, the choice ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences."

# trying to find a suggestion formatting for intellisensible comments

The [realpython comments guide](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/)
webpage had interesting and usefully-presented perspective on comments, but nothing 
like suggestions about intellisensible comment formatting in python.
