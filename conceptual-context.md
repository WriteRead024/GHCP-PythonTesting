"CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the Python language." [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython)&nbsp; 
More information at [python.org](python.org).

"PyPy (/ˈpaɪpaɪ/) is an implementation of the Python programming language.[2] PyPy often runs faster than the standard implementation CPython because PyPy uses a just-in-time compiler.[3]" [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy)&nbsp;
